# Framingham Heart Study Data Analysis

This repository contains biostatistical analyses of the Framingham Heart dataset, conducted as part of coursework in biostatistics. The project applies multiple statistical methods to explore factors associated with cardiovascular disease risk.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

Using the Framingham dataset, this project implements a range of biostatistical techniques to investigate relationships between clinical and demographic variables and cardiovascular outcomes.

The analyses include:
- **Nonparametric methods**
- **Categorical data analysis**
- **Generalized linear models (GLMs)**
- **Linear and generalized linear mixed models (LMMs, GLMMs)**
- **Survival analysis** (Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplanâ€“Meier curves)

Each section corresponds to a major statistical topic covered in the course, and is implemented in **R** with reproducible code.
